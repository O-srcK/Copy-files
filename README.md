Your keyboard or HID device must use one of the .txt files, which will then execute one of the .ps1 payloads. 
The Payload file must be located inside a 'scripts' folder on the USB drive, and then the copied contents will appear in the 'loot' folder
by default, use steal.txt and payload.ps1
**Warning. if the name of the payload file that you use is different, make sure to reflect that in the .txt file aswell**
